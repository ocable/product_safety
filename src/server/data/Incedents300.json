    "Incident Description": "I am a pediatrician and a [REDACTED] (although my certification expired this past summer).  Today in the office a family brought in a newborn in an unsafe infant car seat that was deficient in multiple ways.  First and foremost, there was no FMVSS sticker indicating that the seat was legal to be sold in the U.S. (and met safety requirements).  Additionally, the harness was only a 3-point harness - not a 5-pt harness - it was missing the straps that connect on either side of the baby's hips. The webbing of the harness straps themselves was half the usual width and there was no chest clip. There were only 2 slots to adjust the shoulder harness height - but in fact, it was impossible to adjust the harness because the shoulder straps exited the rear of the seat and ran in one continuous loop through another piece of webbing that connected to the adjustment strap that exits between the baby's feet.  Instead, the straps should have been connected to a metal splitter plate.  The plastic was flimsy as well.  I have previously made a report about a seat manufactured by \"[REDACTED]\" in 2017.  It was Report No. [REDACTED] submitted on Thursday, November 16, 2017. This seat had the same deficiencies as the one in the report in 2017.\n\nThe family received the seat as a gift so they were unable to tell me where they purchased it.  However, I found an identical appearing product advertised on Amazon.  The manufacturer is listed as \"Hustlepapa\". Here is the link:[REDACTED]\n\nI reported the product as unsafe to Amazon.  There are several other product listings on Amazon of similarly appearing \"travel systems\".  These products are illegal to sell in the U.S..  In fact, on one of the product pages (manufactured by [REDACTED]), there are multiple reviews that comment about the missing chest clip and that the stickers indicating that the seat meets the FMVSS standards are missing.  The product page for the [REDACTED] system is: [REDACTED]",

(See photos included on Poppyseed Play website and in attachments.)  He got the tape into his mouth, and started choking on it. It is by pure luck that we happened to see it happen and removed the tape from his mouth before he could not breathe. The tape is not necessary for the product to function and should never have been included on the toy. The tape is clear, small, and easy to miss -- and on a part of the toy that babies can easily reach.",

It seems that the cause of this issue is a new [REDACTED] -like coating that covers the internals of the aluminum boiler that is a new design for this machine in 2023. Several people have begun noticing this and confirmed the issue, so I checked and found the issue on my unit as well. It is unclear at the moment how serious of a safety concern this is, but for a new and relatively premium product, it is unacceptable to have flakes of some [REDACTED] -like material being deposited into brewed coffee.",

My daughter was born 3 days ago, and we came home from the hospital today. When I placed her in the bassinet, I noticed that she had a tendency to roll onto one side. This is highly unusual, as she is far too young to have acquired this developmental milestone. I took out a leveler and confirmed that the bassinet is tilted to one side, which causes the baby to roll onto one side when placed in it. This is highly concerning as infants rolling onto their side (and from there, to their stomachs) is a known risk factor for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",

    "Incident Description": "I purchased the Flexsteel Midway Power Reclining Sofa and Loveseat from Furniture and Appliancemart in Stevens Point, WI. During a visit from my grandchildren in November 2023, I noticed that my 5 year old granddaughter was sitting on the loveseat and her foot/leg naturally slid inside of the space between the seat cushion and the back cushion. When looking further into this I found that the space between the seat cushion and back cushion was 5+ inches and I could fit a spaghetti squash(the size of a child's head) into this space. The power controls to recline the sofa/loveseat are on the inside of the sofa arm, therefore, a child could definitely get a foot/leg or head in that space and also intentionally or by accident hit the control button which would power the couch to go back to original position. This action could crush a child's head.\n\nI have tried to call Furniture and Appliancemart as well as Flexsteel without any reasonable resolution. I first contacted [REDACTED] at Furniture & Appliancemart in November 2023 They added more filling into the cushion which did not make a change in the 5+ inch space between the cushions. I then contacted [REDACTED]  at Flexsteel on 11/16/23 because Furniture and Appliancemart said they could do nothing further to help. [REDACTED] said she will work through Furniture & Appliancemart and will contact Furniture & Appliancemart with recommendations. I have made several calls to Furniture & Appliancemart as well as Flexsteel and have not had anyone address the issue further. I have also requested the safety specifications from Flexsteel and Furniture & Appliancemart, but have not received it. On 2/13/2024 I called Flexsteel again and spoke with [REDACTED]. I asked to speak with a manager. [REDACTED]  said [REDACTED]  would call me back. To date, I have not heard from [REDACTED]  or [REDACTED]. I'm not sure what else I can do to prevent injury or death by this power reclining sofa/loveseat. I have four grandchildren ages 6, 4, 4, and 9 months that visit often. In fact, I babysit them full time in the summer and just don't want them to get hurt.",

    "Incident Description": "There is already one recall for the knobs on this cooktop, however there are MANY issues with it.  Its how easily it ignites. \n How easily the gas comes on.  The knobs turn without any resistance. A dog, a child, putting away dishes, cleaning, walking by it...any bump/contact turns the knob.Many times including today.  I also reported this more than a year ago  when I reported the now button recall here.  The gas pressure keeps raising over time,  the amount of gas coming from each burner keeps increasing over time.  We reported this as part of the warranty and they adjusted it but its again much worse. This is just a poorly made system but I paid a lot and it should be recalled",

    "Incident Description": "I have a 2022 Kubota XG850 sidekick. The engine puts gas in the oil. Kubota refuses to admit publicly they have a problem. If you research internet groups you will see this is widespread. I feel like this machine is unsafe by the amount of gas getting into the crankcase. My machine is on its 5th oil change in about 90 hrs. I sent 1 sample off to a lab it was about 4% gas at\n12 hrs. The 1 I wish I would have sent Im guessing was 20 %. at30-40 hrs total machine time and its second oil change for breakin purposes. The oil flowed out when drained like water and smelled of gas. Kubota has taken my machine in and cant find a defect. The rep from Kubota told me on the phone mine has the updated engine and it should not be doing this. Well it is and I am waiting nor a catastrophic failure of the machine because gas explodes.\nThe only explanation they gave me is that I am not operating the machine correctly. I am 55 years old and have operated a lot of machines. This is an unsafe machine with gas in the oil. Please look into this there are many people having these unsafe machines. I cant even take my grandkids on it without fear of an explosion. Feel free to call me",

    "Incident Description": "Playing with EASTER Squish Stretch Ball by way to celebrate, our daughter who just turned 10 this day was sitting on her bed squishing it in her hand , when she came screaming in hysterics to the kitchen saying she needs help, her eye was burning and to get it out. I have never seen my daughter react this way before. While trying to flush her eye with water and get out of her what was in her eye and what happened.  She told us she was squishing the ball and it popped. This stuff didnt just pop it exploded. It was all over her bed, her floor, her stuff animals and it hardened fast. We looked at the packaging to see what warning the warning label said, the only one listed was choking hazard, small parts not for children under 3. The only item listed for ingredients was Cream glue. At this point my daughters eye was red, burning, and having white crusty forming from what I assume was the  glue. My wife rushed her to urgent care where she was checked out by the Dr. and prescribed Erythromycin eye ointment to apply every 4 hours. Now you tell me how fun it is to try and put this ointment in my childs eye after what happened. The warning label needs to be more accurate. I posted a review of this product on the website and it was removed. This was not a great ending to my daughters 10th Birthday!",

About 4 nights ago, around [REDACTED], while my wife and I were sleeping, the foundation randomly gave out. Not only did this startle the two of us, but I ended up rolling off my side of the bed and swiftly to the floor. My right shoulder and hip are sore but I have not yet sought medical attention for this. After checking out the broken side of the bed foundation, it appears that the welded part of the metal framework had broken. The mattress has been fine, but this is the second time weve had issues with the foundation. Unfortunately, this time it resulted in mild injury. I contacted Nectar and I was told I was slightly outside of the 3 year warranty window for the foundation. Now I am bed-less  and in pain from the accident.",

The stove was installed on December 11, 2023. I read the manual and\npracticed using all features. When I used the air fryer component the stove\ncaught fire. I was able to extinguish the flame but there was a metal pan that\nwas damaged (burnt). I live in a multifamily condominium in a flat (one unit)\napartment that has 2 smoke detectors. Both alarms went off and the\napartment immediate filled with smoke. I am lucky that I have a window in the\nkitchen and another in the adjacent dining area, as well as a living room\nwindow. All windows had to be open and a tower fan turned on to get the\nsmoke out of the apartment. If I had been distracted, my neighbors would\nhave called the fire department by hearing multiple alarms and smoke could\nhave entered the common hallway.\n\nI called your customer service to report the incident on December 22, 2023. A\nservice appointment was made for December 27, 2023 with [REDACTED] No repairman showed up. I again contacted Frigidaire customer\nservice and again told them about the fire in the stove. I requested a different\nrepair service company because of my inability to contact G&amp;G Appliance\nabout the missed appointment. Another repair service call was scheduled for\nJanuary 4, 2024 with [REDACTED] . The repairman came and said the\nfire was caused by grease. I showed him the burnt pot and he said he\nsmelled grease. I told him that I had already used the steam cleaning and\nself-cleaning features and the stove was clean. He turned the air fryer on at\n500 degrees and told me to open all the windows for 1 hour to burn off the\ngrease.",

The odor was overpowering and others in my household noticed. The scanner did not work properly. I then went to eat dinner.

Turning off the device made the odor stop but I continued wheezing and having shortness of breath for several hours afterward.",

Sadly, just like many other juvenile product companies, Wildchild has responded to and investigated a small number of tragic reports like this one. While the loss of any child is devastating, none of those reports have shown that our docks were the cause of those tragedies. The safety of children is of the utmost importance at Wildchild. We are committed to offering multi-functional solutions for families and, most importantly, to providing safe places for children and babies to lounge, play, and experience the world around them.\n\n \n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, we have invested heavily in collaborating with the leading experts on research, testing, and product safety standards. We would like to emphasize that DockATot docks are intended for use while children are awake and under the supervision of a caretaker. They should not be used for sleep of any kind. Wildchild ceased marketing the Deluxe+ dock for any type of sleep in every country where it is sold years ago.\n\n \n\nWildchild fully supports the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines on safe sleep for babies, including that babies should always be placed to sleep on their back in a bare crib or bassinet, without soft toys, pillows, blankets, or other soft bedding or products. Unfortunately, this report does not contain sufficient information to understand what may have occurred. We encourage consumers with questions or concerns about our products to contact us at hello@dockatot.com."

    "Incident Description": "I own an indoor vertical farming system with LED light kits that are designed specifically for the product, called the Lettuce Grow Farmstand and Glow Rings. It is designed to be self-contained, with timers for both the lights and the water pump, so that the water is pumped up through a vertical pipe to the top of the farmstand, then filters out and down to water the plants. The only interaction with the farmstand occurs when you plant, harvest, or do the twice yearly cleaning and restocking of all plants they recommend.  The pump turns on once an hour for 15 minutes of watering, and the LED Glow Lights are on for 16 hours a day per the instructions provided. Otherwise there is not a common use of the product in the conventional sense. \nToday as I sat at my dining room table working on my laptop, I smelled what I can only describe as a hot glue gun burning. I went all over the place investigating, inside and out. I came back inside and noticed the lights were off on the farmstand but the water pump was working. As I began to dissemble the stand I found that two of the Glow Ring wires had caught fire and melted together, then began to melt the internal, vertical pipe that carries the water up and out to the plants. No injuries occurred.",

    "Incident Description": "My wife and child were seated as normal in the Pottery Barn Dream Manual Glider Recliner (https://www.potterybarnkids.com/products/dream-recliner/) and while pressing the manual recline latch, the back of the chair broke off on one side and led both mom and child to tip over and fall.   Both wife and child were thrown to the floor as a result of the part breaking out of its socket.  My wife is 110 lbs and my child is 20 lbs.  Thankfully, injuries were only minor - pulled back muscle and soreness for wife, and temporary pain for child outside of the emotional situation - but could have been significant.  \nThe product is not made safely, does not adhere to Pottery Ban Kids Anti-Tipping Testing nor their Global Safety Standards.\n\nUpon reaching out to Pottery Barn Kids multiple times verbally (their email is not monitored they said), they have refused to provide any level of satisfactory customer service for the injured consumers.  This includes replacing the furniture given was negligently assembled by the product owner, providing replacement parts for their furniture, or refunding the consumer for the faulty product.  They also showed complete disregard for human injury, particularly to the child.\nThe company advised that because the product was purchased over 30 days ago, nothing can be done.  In fact, they were unable to even view our original order # [REDACTED] from May 2022 because it was over 1 year old (surely, there must be information record keeping requirements for companies like this?).\nThe company also advised that they have a one year warranty on furniture products such as this, which they advised is NOT provided explicitly to consumers.  We found this to be very odd that a warranty exists but is NOT disclosed to a consumer?  How is a consumer to know when they are purchasing or even after if there is any recourse?  This seems to be deceptive sales practices at its finest, and surely a regulatory compliance issue.\n\nThis is a safety issue for the product that we do not want any other family to go through.\nThere clearly are policies and standards that Pottery Barn Kids has in place to protect consumers from these issues, yet they are both not clear to its consumers and not followed.\nWhen safety issues do arise, the company is grossly negligent in attempting to resolve them with their consumers.",

Two humans and two dogs have skin, respiratory, and potentially other issues that may be contributed to the long-term fiberglass exposure. At the time of purchase, there was no information on the use of fiberglass/glass fibers in the fire sock of the mattress listed on the Zinus page on Amazon or in the product manual. Since the fiberglass had been leaking from the mattress for an extended period of time, most fabric items including clothing and carpet are contaminated and must be disposed of. All items in the house have to be cleaned and the house emptied to be cleaned by a professional remediation company, following a similar process as mold or asbestos.",

The bed tilts and sags, collapsing a bit in the middle, and I regularly have to shift it around to get it to sit straight. It is currently propped up by bricks to stay upright and not snap in half or collapse entirely. The product being used was an Andover Mills Part #: W004201266 bed from Wayfair, advertised as the \"Aileen Tufted Upholstered Low Profile Platform Bed\" on the wayfair platform. The bed is about two years old. I began having issues with it after less than 6 months. I am the only person using this product. My dog also uses it. It is a queen sized bed and the specs say that it should support up to 500lbs. My dog and I combined are under half of that weight, and this is still happening. The product has been used for sleeping and lounging. There have been no high energy activities on this bed, no jumping onto it, no significant moving while in it. I did not get injured because I moved off the bed right when I felt it snapping, and did not use it again until I was able to purchase bricks from the hardware store to stabilize it. However, If I were heavier, was sleeping with a friend or partner in this bed, or continued to use it before purchasing bricks to support it, I am positive it would've snapped and collapsed entirely and potentially caused injury.",

    "Incident Description": "I purchased two 16 ounce Philadelphia Eagles Glasses 1/23/24 from Fanatics.com.  The product description states, Dishwasher Safe.  That is one of the main reasons I bought the glasses.  But after I put the first glass in the Dishwasher, the Philadelphia script, Eagles script, Eagle, silver line, and green line decals are dismembered with some completely missing.  I will attach photos, but have to return the glasses.  In small type on the box is this statement, \"Glassware Is Top Shelf Dishwasher Safe.\"  I placed the glass in the top shelf of my Dishwasher.  This damage and the release of potentially harmful substances should not have happened to a Dishwasher Safe item.  That is false advertising to misleadingly promote an item to be Dishwasher Safe, when in fact it is NOT Dishwasher Safe, and potentially harmful substances were detached from the glass.  I did not want to put the other glass in the Dishwasher for fear that harmful materials would come off the glass.  This is a consumer safety issue.  If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone.  Fanatics sells and manufacturer Logo Brands makes a wide range of 16 ounce glasses featuring decals of many sports teams.  That means there is a potential that those products are NOT Dishwasher Safe.  I tried to locate the decals missing from the glass, but could not find them in the Dishwasher.  These are small decals, which if detached from the glass can very possibly be ingested by a consumer.  This can be harmful.  Both on Fanatics website and Logo Brands website, these glasses are marketed as Dishwasher Safe.  It could be that the glasses I received were defective (which is unsafe).  Or it could be that these glasses are NOT Dishwasher Safe.  I believe this warrants further investigation.  Through chats, emails, and finally after I demanded a number to call a Fanatics Customer Service Supervisor, I was able to get explanations.  An email from a Fanatics customer service representative stated, \"Unfortunately, the Philadelphia Eagles 16oz. Pint Glass Two Pack is not dishwasher safe like the site states.  We are working to get the information updated/removed as soon as possible.\"  The supervisor told me he will monitor to make sure the Dishwasher Safe statement is removed from the online product description.  So Fanatics admitted in writing that the product it promotes as Dishwasher Safe is NOT Dishwasher Safe.  Meanwhile, the only response I received from Logo Brands showed little concern.  As I did with Fanatics, I asked for confirmation from Logo Brands that these glasses are Dishwasher Safe.  I can provide the entire email text, but for now, here is the response from a Logo Brands customer service representative, \"I would say that most of our glasses are dishwasher safe, but like any product there can be a problem during manufacturing and errors can occur.\"  Logo Brands does not seem willing to even consider the possibility that one or any or all of their products are not Dishwasher Safe.  So I am filing this report.  I hope the CPSC pursues this investigation to determine if what happened to me was because of a defective item (a safety issue) or a product claimed to be Dishwasher Safe that is in fact NOT Dishwasher Safe (also a safety issue).  If these glasses are not safe to be washed in the dishwasher, then they should NOT be marketed as Dishwasher Safe.",

The microwave turntable was burning hot and could not be touched. The microwave was then turned off at the breaker box. I firmly believe that if we were not home, this would have caught on fire. No other items in the kitchen were in use or affected. This was on a separate working breaker.",

    "Incident Description": "The inflator on my BCD (scuba vest) malfunctioned while I was on a dive (scuba dive). It got stuck in the on position which caused it to automatically inflate my BCD when I was roughly 100 feet under water. I could not get it to stop inflating. I had to use my emergency dump air valve multiple times in order to safely ascend to the surface to end the dive. This is very dangerous. If a diver goes up too fast, the diver can suffer a stroke, a heart attack, joint damage, irreversible lung damage, and/or a whole host of other bad things, including death in some cases. I was diving long enough at depth that there would have been a very bad result. The BCD is pretty new, has been cleaned thoroughly after every dive, and has been routinely serviced. It had to be manufactured incorrectly or they used materials that degrade too fast when used in the ocean (which is where people dive much of the time) There is no reason the BCD inflator should have malfunctioned in this manner and it was not due to user error. I have contacted the manufacturer (Huish Outdoors - Oceanic) and they now have my BCD in their possession. They are trying to get me to pay to have it fixed. I no longer trust this equipment with my life nor do I trust the manufacturer to fix the problem in a manner that does not place my life at risk in the future. I have spoken with other divers on Scuba discussion boards and there are others who have experienced similar problems. Unfortunately, only those who live to tell can report issues. I want a full refund so I can purchase a good quality BCD but my primary concern and objective is getting an unsafe product off of the market. There was already another recall from this same manufacturer on a weight pocket issue. The handles broke. This is dangerous because the handles are needed so that a diver can dump weights in an emergency situation. It is a drowning hazard to have faulty weight pockets.",

Later that same day, an Abram’s Nation Repair Specialist, Project Manager, and its Founder/President participated in a phone call and a video call with consumer. During the video call, the Abram’s Nation team instructed consumer on how to correctly install the coverlet. \n\nConsumer followed-up via email after the video call that they were able to correctly install a different coverlet. Abram’s Nation requested that consumer provide it with the original coverlet for inspection and repair, if necessary. \n\nAfter receiving the original coverlet in a pre-paid parcel he had coordinated for consumer, the Abram’s Nation Repair Specialist reported back to consumer that the original coverlet was in good condition. The Repair Specialist determined that consumer had incorrectly installed the original coverlet and stated, “now you understand the correct way to zip in the coverlet sheet and everything should go smoothly from here on out.” \n\nConsumer expressed hesitancy regarding continued use of the original coverlet. The Repair Specialist provided a video to consumer of the original coverlet being installed in-house without incident. Consumer agreed to accept return of the original coverlet.\n\nThe original coverlet was returned. No further communication took place between consumer and Abram’s Nation until a CPSC Complaint was filed regarding the January 8th complaint. Abram’s Nation considers this complaint to be resolved, having conducted an in-house inspection of the product. After investigation, Abram’s Nation concluded that the product was in good and usable condition and any issue with the product was caused by user-error."

Or a manufacturer has a manufacturing problem and....a doir plug goes flying off a plane in flight. Or faulty air bag initiators get installed in cars, blow up, and people are injured or killed by shrapnel. Remember those stories. We live in a world where parts used can be defective.

I have been using it since my 6-month old child was about ten days old. As time as gone on, I've noticed it is no longer level, which is causing my baby to roll to one side and he recently woke up rolled to that side. Because safe sleep requires a flat surface, I have discontinued use of the product due to the risk of suffocation.",

    "Incident Description": "4/2023:   The fuel tank came loose inside of the snow blower.  Initially, the consumer was not exactly sure what was wrong with the product and he was putting it away for the Spring/Summer.  Therefore, he did not address the issue at that time.  \n\nSometime later, he found that the fuel cap was the only thing holding the fuel tank in place.  Furthermore, there is a single mount that attaches to the underside of the snow blower’s housing, which had broken away and left the fuel tank dangling inside the snow blower.\n\n\nThe consumer called the firm to advise them about the issue, because once the fuel tank’s cap is removed the fuel tank could fall inside of the engine and spill gas. \nAdditionally, the consumer had the unit about a year when he started some maintenance on it.  When he removed the cover, he found that 1 of the maintenance housing mounts had broken away and it seemed that it was not manufactured properly, or that the mount may have been damaged to begin with, when it was assembled.\n\n\n1/18/2024:  He called the firm and reported these issues to their rep. ([REDACTED]).  He was assigned a CASE# [REDACTED], told that the product was out of warranty, but that he could purchase the snow blower’s housing for $80.00+.  The consumer declined that offer, because this is a safety issue and the maintenance cover mount broke, while the machine was under warranty.  The rep. said they could not assist him further.  Nothing else transpired.",

    "Incident Description": "Smoke/CO alarm with a good battery backup indicates high C/O on a momentary loss of power\nMy wife, home alone and sleeping woke up to the alarm screaming high C/O at 1:15 am. Not just beeping but actually saying high C/O. In a panic trying to find out the problem and round up the pets she hears the whole house generator running. Not knowing the whole neighborhood is without electric. It takes less than 30 seconds from loss to the generator picking up the whole house. She now thinks it might be from the generator and is getting out of the house with the 3 cats and 2 dogs. She calls me and I am on my way home less than 10 minutes away. I tell her I have no notifications from our [REDACTED] alarm other than loss of power. I get home to the 3 interconnected alarms blaring and I try to silence them. I can't get them down off the ceiling due to a tamper resistant design( what a great feature on a residential ceiling mounted device). I try to [REDACTED] it on Kidde's website only to find I need to enter the model number that can't be seen until you get it down off the ceiling. I contacted Kidde and there suggested \"repair\" was to unplug it and plug it back in. The Kidde rep. stated this \"should\" fix it and if not next time it does this they will replace it. I said there will not be a next time and I will be replacing all 3 with another brand not made by Kidde. My electric had been off a few times prior to this with no false alarm. As far as the repair of unplugging and then plugging them back in. That is not a repair, that's a fluke. Rebooting your computer is one thing I don't want to have to reboot my smoke alarms.\nI bought what I thought was a name brand product only to have to replace it in a year and a half. The product should not go into a specific incorrect alarm condition over a condition it's not even supposed to detect. It had a good battery backup. This is like your car telling you its overheating when the tire pressure is low in one of the tires. I have zero faith in any Kidde product going forward.",

When touched the box was very hot and soon the dishwasher stopped running.  We pulled the circuit breaker for the dishwasher to ensure safety.  Upon opening the plastic junction box we immediately saw clear signs of burning and melting which seemed to have arisen on the connection block.  I feel we were very lucky not to have experienced a house fire and loss of property - or worse.   Bosch has been contacted and they will be sending a technician to remove the power cord and junction box but they tell me they will replace it with an identical, but new, junction box.

    "Incident Description": "I become very weak and dizzy when I am in a store, office, or church where Fabuloso has been used to clean the building, probably the floor. My office was cleaned on a Tuesday.  I only go to the office on Thursdays.  I walked by the area with tile floors.  I had to lean on the wall for support and could not walk straight.  The office manager contacted the cleaners to instruct them not to use Fabuloso.  I had an allergic reaction twice at the grocery store where I usually shop; getting very weak and unable to stand up straight or walk straight.  The clerks could not answer my question about what cleaning products are used.  I emailed the store but I received no reply.  I went to a different grocery store and my reaction was almost as bad. Every time my strength returned when I went outside.  I no longer go inside grocery stores but I am trying to shop online.  Since the reaction kept getting worse with each incident, I worry that something is accumulating inside my body.  I have to go inside the grocery store to get my prescription medicine but I only stay in a few minutes and I have not had a reaction.  I also had bad reactions several times at my church and the pastor has asked the cleaners to stop using Fabuloso or to dilute the product.",

The grill also burned part of the rear of his home (approximately 50 square feet).\n\nHe contacted the manufacturer by phone and email, several times, and their representative ([REDACTED]) offered parts to repair the grill, but the consumer no longer feels safe with the grill. [REDACTED] said that there was nothing else they could do, because this was not caused by manufacturer’s error.  The consumer said that [REDACTED], indicated that the grill had not been properly maintained/cared for.\n\nThe consumer has been grilling for over 50 years and never experienced a problem like this.  He also saw a similar report on the internet for this manufacturer’s grill.\n\nThe same type of incident occurred with his grill in 2022, but he stopped the fire before it expanded.  There were no injuries with that incident.",

    "Incident Description": "I own a Whirlpool refrigerator model number WRB322DMBM00, serial number K64404587. The freezer drawer, located at the bottom of the refrigerator, has a light switch is activated by a white plastic tab that hangs down from the top center at the front of the freezer. The edges of this actuator are extremely sharp and I have cut the back of my hand a number of times when reaching for items stored on the top shelf. I am on blood thinners so this has resulted in significant bleeding as this sharp piece of plastic is not visible when standing in front of the refrigerator. This is a safety hazard. I looked at similar newer Whirlpool brand refrigerators at Lowe's and found the design of this switch actuator has been improved by mounting the switch horizontally in the front frame of the freezer, made the actuator wider and rounded the edge. This makes the switch clearly visible and eliminates the danger of lacerations by rounding the edge.\n\nI contacted the manufacturer by filling out a request by on their \"contact us\" form at whirlpool.com on 01/28/24 and provided all these details. I received an auto reply confirmation email with the subject line \"We're Here to Help\" confirming all the details and comments I submitted, but to date was never contacted by Whirlpool.",

I was also doing pottery and I set up a studio at home and i thought maybe there was dust that was causing this issues. I bought an air quality device to measure PM2.5 and learned to clean my studio properly. My cough persisted. Weirdly enough, I would cough more when i was in my home office than in my studio. I have been dealing with this cough since August of 2022. I bought air purifiers, I have been changing the filter on my heating system monthly, I had multiple doctor appointments, an XRay of my lungs and nothing was making my cough go away. Then I had a trip and I noticed that I felt better when I was outside of my home. I finally, after two years, decided to throw away the diffuser. The little inconspicuous container that to me never made my house smell like anything, and all of the sudden I feel like a brand new person. I am still coughing a little but also i feel like my brain is clearer too. I was able to feel energized at the gym again. I think whatever chemical was in this product did a number on my lungs and my overall health.",

    "Product Description": "Clew Freedom 1.0 Snowboard bindings. They come in black and white, offer a toe and heel strap with a locking ratchet on the toe and one that releases on the heel. The highback features a handle with a dual spring mechanism that releases to allow the user a fast in and out. They weight about 5lbs. They are mounted to the snowboard with 8 screws 4 on each one for the right and left foot. The purpose of this product is to adhere the user to the snowboard and allow them to be strapped in to it but when they stop riding down the ski slopes they can utilize the handle on the back to disengage it and step out with part of the binding still strapped to their foot.",

    "Incident Description": "I'm a professional snowboard equipment reviewer who has done my job for 20 years. In 2019 I saw a 3D rendering for a new snowboard binding that was being touted as the future of snowboarding. In that 3D rendering I noticed some fatal design flaws that only someone as experienced as myself would and expressed my concerns. The designers of the product dismissed my knowledge base immediately. Fast forward to 2022 and they are rolling out their product and I express my concerns for their product and their limited knowledge of how snowboard bindings work. In 2023 after demand from my audience I bought a pair to review and upon getting the product in my hands and inspecting it I noticed catastrophic design and manufacturing faults. I then took the product to Copper Mountain in Colorado to test them. I posted on [REDACTED]  that I was testing them and 3 different employees from 3 different shops reached out to me and informed me that the mounting hardware that they use was not up to industry spec and were sheering off inside the inserts that they screw into and I was advised to swap out the screws. Upon riding the product I noticed that the locking mechanism that they claim has a fail safe failed me on 3 different laps down the slopes I was testing it on. This caused the safety hook and locking mechanism to disengage and allow the foot to release. As I'm a highly experienced snowboard rider with over 3900 days on snow I knew how to safely stop myself from being injured. But, what I've noticed is that this company will not acknowledge publicly to anyone that these have this issue. Upon further inspection after riding them for only 4 hours I noticed severe deterioration of the plastic used in the product, that the screws had shown signs of fatigue, and that the locking mechanism was already starting to wear and fail. In my expert opinion and as someone who has ridden hundreds of snowboard bindings I could see this failing to the general public. After concluding my review of the product I actually released it on [REDACTED]  has I have done with countless other products and there were over 50 comments out of over 750 that said they had a disengagement issue that caused them to release or that it failed to safely and securely lock in. The company will not acknowledge this and is instead hiring influencers to push the product as safe as well as buy fake reviews to bolster their image. You as a commission have recalled a similar product from [REDACTED] bindings in March of 2012. I feel that a recall of this product due to failure in the locking mechanism, release spring, and insert mounting screws is needed.",

    "Incident Description": "We purchased a Samsung refrigerator (model number RF28T5021SG) on May  23, 2023 from Best Buy.  The refrigerator was working as normal until November 2023, when my wife noticed the temperature inside felt a little warm.  We put a thermometer inside the refrigerator and realized the temperature was over 60F even though the thermostat on the door of the fridge was reading 34F.  We had to throw out a full refrigerator and freezers worth of groceries, including a lot of pumped breast milk that we didn't feel was safe for our infant after being at an unsafe temperature for an unknown period of time.  A repairman came out to look at the unit on 11/30/2023 but by that time it was working as normal again.  He checked some settings on the refrigerator and said he would be in contact in a weeks time to check on the unit.  We kept on eye on the temperature after that and had another incident around February 9, 2024, when the refrigerator again went about 60F, even though the thermostat on the inside of the fridge was still registering 34F.  We again lost a full refrigerator and freezer full of groceries along with more breast milk for our child.   When cleaning out the fridge this time, I noticed lots of food with mold on it suggesting the temperature had been dipping for while.  We're very lucky that our child didn't eat any of this and get sick, because the built in thermostat on the fridge never got above 34F suggesting everything was safe.  We were only able to tell there was issue by using a separate thermometer that tracked maximum temperature recorded each day.  We have started trying to contact Samsung about fixing the issues but are being told the warranty period expired in January 2024, even though the unit was not purchased until May 2023 and they state a one year warranty on the purchase.",

I took that one out of service immediately and requested a replacement from the seller. The replacement was also wired incorrectly. I again contacted the seller, and received a second replacement, which is also wired incorrectly.\n\nNo one has been injured, because I tested these before putting them in service.\n\nI believe that many furniture products for sale are using power strips from the same vendor, but I haven't acquired others to test.",

    "Company Comments": "(2/21/2024) Weber-Stephen Products LLC: The CPSC provided Weber-Stephen Products LLC (“Weber”) with the above-captioned Incident Report (“Report”). While no response is required, Weber has reviewed the Report and is providing the CPSC with further information in accordance with the (10) day publication deadline. At the onset, Weber would like to apologize to the CPSC for having to address this matter. Saferproducts.gov is not the appropriate forum for consumers to enforce warranty claims against manufacturers.\n\nThe consumer initially contacted Weber to make a warranty claim with respect to replacement of his control knobs, Flavorizer® bars and “burners”. A demand for immediate replacement of specific parts was aggressively made, citing that Weber offered an “All Parts-10 Year Warranty.” The consumer mentioned knobs that had cracked, Flavorizer® bars that had warped, and irregular cooking. Cracked knobs could impact his ability to turn all burner tubes on, which could suggest that his grill was placed into by-pass because the proper ignition sequence was not made. Warped Flavorizer® bars is not a condition that is typically reported. Warping usually involves the cooking grates or the cookbox edges and is often associated with high temperature event(s). When asked for details regarding the “irregular cooking” the consumer mentioned a sear burner, a smoker burner, and the main burners. As there is no “smoker burner” on the subject grill, it is unclear which burner(s) the consumer wanted replaced. To complicate matters further, the consumer mentioned that his grill was “professionally piped by a propane company.” This suggests that his grill might be operating with bulk propane or natural gas, despite his grill’s serial number being consistent with a grill manufactured to be used with a 20lb propane tank. The information provided indicated a need for further investigation and possibly different gas train part or other additional replacement parts. All of the aforementioned details, conclusively confirm that further investigation is required in order to determine what replacement parts are appropriate to ensure safe and proper operation of the consumer’s grill.\n\nTo be clear, at no time did Weber refuse to honor its warranty. However, Weber will not provide random gas train parts to a consumer without a proper investigation. Doing so, may not fix the issue, or worse, render a perfectly safe grill unsafe to operate. When a warranty claim is received, Weber’s policy is to troubleshoot with the consumer to determine: 1) why a grill is not operating as it was designed to; and 2) what exact parts are needed to get a consumer back grilling safely. Replacement parts are then sent to the consumer in accordance with the grill’s warranty. The best way for a Consumer Care phone representative to troubleshoot a suspected grill issue is to: 1) obtain a narrative from the consumer; and 2) ask the consumer to take photographs of the grill and specific parts. Unfortunately, the consumer refused to take photos because Weber’s warranty did not specifically state that a consumer has to take photos in order to obtain replacement parts. The consumer advised that he had recently undergone a cardiac procedure, and stated “he would not jump through hoops for Weber” by going outside to take pictures of the grill or it’s affected parts. \n\nThe consumer reiterated his demand for immediate replacement of specific parts he thought should be replaced (despite the fact that the exact “burner tube” or gas train parts had not been identified) citing Weber’s “All Parts 10 Year Warranty”. Weber’s “10 Year Warranty” is a LIMITED warranty. The warranty shown on www.weber.com states “SUMMIT GAS GRILL SERIES – All parts – 10 years (excluding normal wear and tear and subject to additional terms and conditions in the warranty.” The Owner’s Manual for the subject grill further clarifies the warranty terms under the caption “WARRANTY HANDLING/EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY”, which states “WEBER will, upon investigation, repair (or replace)at its option, a defective part that is covered by this warranty”.  Asking the consumer to take photos and provide a narrative is Weber’s attempt to examine, investigate and address the alleged concerns, and ensure that all necessary replacement parts are sent. \n\nDespite his delicate medical condition, the consumer’s temper continued to escalate. Unfortunate threats were made against Weber and against the intake phone rep. (NOTE: it must be recognized that the phone rep exemplified professionalism, respect and control under pressure). The consumer reported an increase in stress, impacting his blood pressure to a point where he asked the phone rep if he wanted to be responsible for him having to call 911 to report an “adverse cardiac event.”\n\nWhile the phone rep was not obligated to do so, as an accommodation to a loyal Weber consumer, he offered to send replacement control knobs and Flavorizer® bars to the consumer without having the required photos. The phone rep then attempted to explain he would have to get a Supervisor’s approval to send gas train replacements. The consumer became enraged, refused the offer and stated “send me everything I asked for or I will escalate to the Pennsylvania Attorney General for false & deceptive business practices, and I’m going to make it difficult for Weber.” \n\nWith this being said, at Weber, we want everyone to have a positive experience with their grill and with our Company. We invite the consumer to reach out to Weber when his medical condition and the weather improves.  We would not want him to be negatively impacted taking photos or performing levels of grill disassembly which would be required to remove and install whatever gas train parts are ultimately deemed to be required for the grill to operate properly. Replacement of the main burners involves significant disassembly of the grill. It may be that replacement  knobs also solve the reported “irregular cooking” issue. \n\nAs we await the Complaint that has allegedly been filed with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office, we can confirm that replacement control knobs have been shipped to the consumer. Replacement Flavorizer® bars are currently on backorder until Friday 2/23/24, and will be shipped out shortly thereafter. Until further troubleshooting occurs, replacement of the “unknown” burner tubes, sight unseen is not an option. If the consumer refuses to work with Weber,  we recommend that he engage a service agent, at his cost, to inspect his grill.  Weber will provide  the no-cost, under warranty parts requested by the aforementioned service agent or licensed gas installer.  As the consumer mentioned that two of his sons worked at the hardware store where he purchased the subject grill, another option would be that perhaps they can assist him with the photos.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that the last line of the Report states “I can personally attest that this grill is unsafe to operate with [sic] the requested parts.\" Please be advised that at no time did the consumer mention to the phone rep that his grill was unsafe to use. His sole focus was on his belief that Weber was refusing to honor its warranty, which we repeat, is not accurate. We are truly sorry that the consumer had a negative experience with Weber, and we hope for a speedy recovery.  We wish to reiterate that this matter does not involve any defect with the SUMMIT® S-670 gas grill currently in use by the consumer which would create a substantial product hazard, or which creates an unreasonable risk of death or serious injury.  We apologize that the CPSC has been brought into this matter."

    "Incident Description": "Having had a new (1-1/2 year old) Frigidaire Refrigerator fail last month, I got to talking to the repair person, who explained he has been seeing compressors fail frequently since the switch to R600, which is butane. Anecdotally, I began to wonder if R600 (butane) was implicated in what seems to me as an increase in home explosions. (What can I say, I was an ICU Burn Nurse for 30 years, I think about this stuff.) I realize the overwhelming number are probably attributable to archaic gas lines, but it did make me wonder. And, I only have access to my own observations, which are often skewed and no substitute for nationwide data.\n\nI had filed a complaint with CPSC regarding the failure, the company's refusal to take responsibility, etc. and I had mentioned this concern at the end of the complaint. CPSC e-mailed a reply and suggested I file a complaint at this e-mail address, so I leave the research in your capable hands. \n\nI want to make crystal clear that my refrigerator did not do anything except stop working. I just wondered, after my conversation with the repair person, if the problem could be wider than just compressors failing and actually concern overheating, fan failures and then explosions. Also, manufacturer date is a guess since the form would not accept Don't Know or N/A in that spot, but it was manufactured before 4/13/2022 when I bought it new.",

The product purports to have both CO2 and Fire alarm detection ability but is MISSING the CO2 detection cylinder.  In the place of the detection cylinder is a brake-away plastic shape that is not filled with the CO2 detection cylinder.  On the advertisement web page there is an internal parts diagram and it clearly shows that cylinder as one that is supposed to be there.  This is a potentially life threatening problem as people are unaware of the problem with their detectors.  Also, the same packaging seller ANKA sells other combinations of the potentially the same fire/CO2 (purported) alarms, and they look like they are the same (though I did not examine all of ANKA's products, but just one that is being reported.)  The serial number of this particular unit is 010082021051300221 and it was manufactured on 03/17/2022 in China.  Please examine the issue and make the company stop selling this (and other such) dangerous product(s) and hopefully make them recall the product as well for the sake of health of those who have already acquired these units.

I unplugged the USB cord from my laptops charging / connection port and allowed over an hour for this electronic device to safely cool down, showing no sign on the outside of being damaged.  I opened the battery compartment on that same side to discover that the Brother rechargeable Battery (Li-Ion) 3.7V 1700mAh  6.29Wh Model LD0665001 (still being sold) was expanded inside the battery slot that took some effort to remove.  Sitting in a storage bag for this mobile scanner were two additional Brother batteries, one which was already expanded.  I reported this to Brother CS/Technical Support and was assigned incident [REDACTED].  Brother claimed battery is no longer being sold by them, their own website says differently.

    "Incident Description": "I had been smelling a faint burning smell for a few days but couldn't tell where it was coming from, then the smell suddenly got worse and could tell it was coming from my Vornado fan. I picked up the fan and suddenly there was a spark / flash and smoke and my breaker tripped. Looking closely at the fan I could see the power cord was brittle and falling apart at the base of the fan where it enters through the grommet.\nI contacted Vornado about the incident and included the pictures I took, and I have received multiple form letters back from their customer service with generic form emails asking for information I've already provided, twice. The conversations in email make it clear that no one from Vornado has actually read what I wrote, there is no acknowledgement from them that they're aware this incident occurred, it's clearly generic auto-responses that I keep receiving only acknowledging that \"we are behind in responding to emails\".\n\nIn summary: My Vornado fan's power cord started smouldering and then shorted out while I was holding it to examine where the burning smell was coming from, and not due to abuse or damage created by me. The insulation on the cord became brittle, started breaking apart, and caused a short. I was using the product myself, the fan was on my floor.  I almost got electrocuted by picking the unit up and holding it. I have detailed pictures showing the damage on the cord, and the model and serial# of the fan. I have no children or pets, this fan has been sitting undisturbed for years and was used every night.",

He noticed the grill was not heating. [REDACTED] tapped on the regulator when the grill exploded and burst into high flames that almost burnt the house down.  [REDACTED] threw the grill from the driveway to the yard to get it away from the house. We had to call 911 and have them send the fire department to put the fire out. Flames were up to 10-15 feet high and continued for several minutes. We have video evidence.  There was some burn damage to the siding on the house and the HVAC unit as well as personal injury damage to his shoulder and back from throwing the grill. (The shoulder had a previously injury that was aggravated)  Nexgrill has denied both a refund and any compensation for ongoing PT sessions, claiming the burden was on him to test and inspect his grill before every use.  The video we have pretty much speaks for itself. If a consumer is obligated to do a thorough review every time they use an expensive product to avoid being blown up or burnt or having the house burnt down, then something is clearly wrong with the product. It seems Nexgrill has had regulator issues in the past as recalled by the CPSC and it further seems they have not remedied the matter.",

Originally, I believed them to be Calcium and Magnesium from the boiled water.  Today (1/17/2024), I did a deep clean and heard something rattle in the lid.  I removed the lid from the unit and removed the 3 screws that hold the unit together.  \n\nWhat I found was disturbing, not only was the metal rusted (supposed to be stainless steel), _BUT_ the plastic was disintegrating.  The small white pellets were plastic, not mineral deposits.   So, basically, I have been poisoning my drinking water for an undetermined amount of time from injesting rust and plastic.",

Black substance in the image likely results from insufficient cleaning after brewing. The body, lid, bottom, coffee filter, and coffee tube of this SR-CP-50B coffee barrel are all made of 304 stainless steel, while the heating cup is made of aluminum, with no coating treatment. Under normal usage, no metal shavings should be shed. Moreover, similar products on the market typically feature the same structural design. Recommend thorough cleaning after each use, particularly of aluminum cup area, using abrasive brush and periodic deep cleaning with citric acid or other agents."

I unplugged it and took it outside and put it in a metal box in case it caught fire. I checked this morning and it is no longer hot, but it still smells like burnt chemicals. Needless to say it is no longer working either. It doesnt *look* like theres damage just by looking at it. But it wont turn on, theres something rattling in it, and if you touch it, it makes your hand stink. \n\nI thought you should know so this doesnt happen to someone else. We have only ever used the charger that came with the monitor. I hate to think what would have happened if I hadnt woken up in time. I also hate to think about what we were breathing in and for how long that was burning my nose and throat that bad. Theres no way thats healthy for people.",

    "Incident Description": "CPSC,\n\nIn short, my new GE CAFE refrigerator cannot keep its temperature under 40. It may cool down to 34 but the differential allows the refrigerator to heat up, in many cases, above 40 before it starts cooling again. It seems that this is GE's way of trying to save energy or save on compressor wear. Either way it meant loss of food and I believe, in some cases where people do not use a thermometer, food poisoning. I understand that Samsung is involved in a lawsuit right now for this very issue.\n\nThe below paragraphs reference log files located on my website at [REDACTED]\n\nI bought a GE CAFE refrigerator in late December of last year. I installed it on 12-23-23, set it for 37 degrees, waited 24 hours, then loaded the refrigerator with food. Shortly after then I noticed that my food, mainly smoothies were not cold. I set the refrigerator to 34 and put in a cheap refer thermometer that I used for my old refrigerator. For a couple of days I noted that it would never get below 40. I started testing the temperature with my [REDACTED] and it showed that, even though the refrigerator display showed 34, the actual temperature in most cases was over 39 and many times over 40, 45 and as high as 52\n\nI then switched to a [REDACTED] logging meter on 1-9-24 and started logging the temperature in 5 minute intervals for 24hrs. It showed that the refrigerator has at least an 8 differential/hysteresis setting from the set point of 34. I lost all my vegetables the next day. I emptied the new refrigerator back to my old one. I contacted GE and a tech came out on 1-23-24. His data he showed me had the same high numbers 45, 48 and higher. He contacted his tech support and I over heard that the temperature differential could be as high as 10. Even though the tech on the phone said it is a fairly normal, I insisted is was not so the tech at my house ordered e new board(he really did understand the issue).\n\nWhile I was waiting for the new board, I logged my old 2001 [REDACTED] refrigerator and its differential is 3 and has no problem keeping the temp under 37(Check Graph). I received the board and got the OK from the GE tech to install the board myself. I installed it on 2-1-24, waited 24 hours, then began logging temps again. Although the refrigerator worked better, it was still not able to hold the temp under 40 while the set point was 34(34 degrees is the lowest setting). I did 3 24hr tests, one at 34, one at 37 and one at 40. All results were very poor. This refrigerator will not keep the temperature at or below the set point. The logs here: [REDACTED] show the results. Please show these results to a tech that understands [REDACTED] logging values. I also have all the number data that makes up these graphs. I also included the [REDACTED] results for comparison.\n\nIn all test cases, once the refrigerator reached its set temperature, the actual control display temperature will show that \"set point\" temperature no matter what the real recorded temperature was. I find this very misleading and I would say that most people who have these refrigerators do not know that they are probably over temp for FDA recommendations for safe refrigerator temperature.\n\nI just emailed the GE tech saying the problem is not fixed. I suspect that GE will drag me and their tech through the mud on this. I do not believe GE can provide me a refrigerator that can keep a temperature under the set point of 37 because of how they want to control their compressors. I would like my money back now instead of doing this months long walk of never getting a refrigerator that works for me.\n\nAre we allowing refrigerator companies to have and average for a set point? If that is the case then the average of 47 and 27 is 37 meaning they could allow the refrigerator to heat up to 47 before cooling and call it good. You can see that with my logs. Unfortunately I see why regulation comes into play with stuff like this.\n\nI would welcome CPSC or anyone else to come and test this refrigerator. They have been to my house to test another appliance.\n\nAm I stuck with a refrigerator that cannot cool properly? What is my recourse? How are these companies being allowed to do this?",

It was very sharp and scraped her tongue when I got it out quickly, thankfully shes okay. I found out it was these little car toys her great-grandma had gotten her for Christmas. The product is intended for 6M-18M olds, so it makes me scared for the other babies using it and their parents not catching it in time. They have a little ball on the inside that supposed to make noise and be a sort of rattle, but the balls on all of them I found were either cracked or broke and the way the toy is designed the broken plastic will come right out where the baby playing with them can get their hands on it.

    "Incident Description": "I recently purchased a Lectric XP Step-Thru 3.0 White Long-Range eBike. When the bike was delivered, the rear tire/tube was deflated and separated from the bicycle. Upon contacting the company about this issue, I was informed that there was a known defect in the tubes and wheels for the bicycle I purchased. I was told that a batch of the bikes had weak tubes prone to rupture, burrs on the wheel rims that could lead to repeated tube punctures, and/or screws sticking out on the rims that could lead to repeated tube punctures. After I reported the issue, I received what seemed to be a form email about possible fixes for these issues. I had no idea that this was an issue before I purchased this bike, I was not informed about this issues before I received the bike, and I did not find out until I contacted customer service. As far as I know, no widespread notice has been sent out to customers about this issue as I have not received any such public notice even though the product I purchased was affected. I suppose I was lucky, because if my tire had not arrived deflated, I might have thought that the inevitable flat tire was due to user error or environmental hazard. I was never put in harms way because I have been unable to ride the bike even once. However, those customers that are not informed of these defects may repeatedly experience flat tires without understanding that the cause may be a defect with the bicycle wheels and tubes. Lectric offered to pay for me to get the problems repaired, but in the end I could not access a bike shop that would handle the issue. So that I could repair the bike myself, Lectric eventually agreed to send me new front and rear wheels, which are currently on backorder until the end of October. Originally I was told that there would be no point in them sending me new wheels because the new wheels might have the same problem. This indicates that they know there is a problem, but have not fixed it, and are not necessarily checking the products they send out to the public. I recently read about their disc brake caliper recall on the same model bike I purchased (albeit different dates), and this makes me worried about the safety of the product in general.",

Most importantly, they can bite the wires in the stove, which will cause a terrible fire!  If this continues, it will pose of a huge threat to the health and safety of all users.\n\nOur experience: \n\nIn January 2021, my family bought this stove from Home Depot. After using a few times, we often found dirty secretions and mice droppings in the oven. \n\nWe have used various stoves for over 30 years. Since moving into the current house in 2003, we have used two gas stoves and never had such an issue. We really did not know, then, how it could have happened?\n\nOn July 2022, after wiping off the mice droppings in the oven, I turned on the Self Clean for the first time. Suddenly, the stove was on fire, and a large amount of black smoke and burning smell came out of the stove, so I turned off  Self Clean immediately to avoid danger.\n\nIn order to find the dead mice and clean it thoroughly, I opened the metal plates at the bottom of the oven and back of the stove. There were numerous mice feces and secretions scattered inside, especially in the white asbestos-like insulation above at the back of the stove. Due to configuration of the stove, I was unable to open more parts. So I needed help and had to contact GE. \n\nExperience with GE:\n\nFrom July25, 2022 to now, GE (appliancesupport@geappliances.com) and I emailed each other 26 times. However, they insisted there were no new design defects and all problem came from the mice.  They repeatedly emphasized that the one-year warranty of the range has expired. In sum, they simply pushed me away and refused to help at all, whether it be a stove exchange, refund, recall, or at least sending someone to investigate the issue. \n\nGE Appliances Support said: \n\n1.  On July27, 2022   \n\"Here are some local servicers in your area. You will need to call them to see if any of them would be able to come out and help you clean the oven.

Gas Range with Self-Cleaning Convection Oven and Air Fry in Stainless Steel.    Store SKU # 1005649087   Internet # 314138082    Model # JGB735SPSS   [REDACTED]\nIt has:\n\tFour large slots on the metal cover at the bottom of the oven.\n\tA big hole under the metal cover that directly leads to the exit big hole at the back of the stove.     \n\tAnother bigger hole at the back of the stove that directly leads to the inside of the stove.\n\tThere are no mesh or ventilable barrier between the entrance and exit holes.\nAs a result:\nMice, small animals and various bugs can freely access the inside of the stove and oven. These creatures may carry bacteria, viruses and various pathogenic microorganisms. They can easily contaminate the food and utensils in the oven, and spread diseases. Most importantly, they can bite the wires in the stove, which will cause a terrible fire!  If this continues, it will pose of a huge threat to the health and safety of all users.Our experience: \n\nIn January 2021, my family bought this stove from Home Depot. After using a few times, we often found dirty secretions and mice droppings in the oven. \nWe have used various stoves for over 30 years. Since moving into the current house in 2003, we have used two gas stoves and never had such an issue. We really did not know, then, how it could have happened?\n\nOn July 2022, after wiping off the mice droppings in the oven, I turned on the Self Clean for the first time. Suddenly, the stove was on fire, and a large amount of black smoke and burning smell came out of the stove, so I turned off  Self Clean immediately to avoid danger.\n\nIn order to find the dead mice and clean it thoroughly, I opened the metal plates at the bottom of the oven and back of the stove. There were numerous mice feces and secretions scattered inside, especially in the white asbestos-like insulation above at the back of the stove. Due to configuration of the stove, I was unable to open more parts. So I needed help and had to contact GE. \n\nExperience with GE:\n\nFrom July25, 2022 to now, GE (appliancesupport@geappliances.com) and I emailed each other 26 times. However, they insisted there were no new design defects and all problem came from the mice.  They repeatedly emphasized that the one-year warranty of the range has expired. In sum, they simply pushed me away and refused to help at all, whether it be a stove exchange, refund, recall, or at least sending someone to investigate the issue. \n\nGE Appliances Support said: \n\n1.  On July27, 2022   \n\"Here are some local servicers in your area. You will need to call them to see if any of them would be able to come out and help you clean the oven. I cannot send a GEA technician out until you send me a document from an exterminator stating the mouse issue has been taken care of in the home.\"  \n(My response: On Aug 16, 2022, sent to GE the documents from the exterminator)\n\n2.

Did he say why he did not do the same with the other one? \n(My response: \"Because theyre not technicians of appliance.

It was cheaper to buy a new one than to have it repaired. The second microwave door handle broke shortly after it was just outside its warranty as well.

    "Company Comments": "(2/14/2024) EMPIRE COMFORT SYSTEMS, INC.: The complaint does not have enough detail. The lack of detail means I may not be answering the complaint accurately. The inaccurate packaging I would counter with the following: The OUTSIDE of the carton has photographs of the unit in color similar to what a glossy brochure might have so there are very descriptive photographs on our cartons for Gravity Wall Furnaces. There are also drawings showing the tools you need to install the units. We have tried to show as much information as possible so that a consumer can try to determine how the unit will look in the space to be installed as well as the possible easy install/or not depending on the installer's skill level. This is a major gas appliance and is not intended to be installed by a novice gas furnace installer. The instruction packet is directly under the unit. The unit is supported by styrofoam in the carton and this allows the instruction packet to be out of harms way as it does contain installation pieces. I could add more. We have been selling this model to the market for years and early on our customers gave us ideas, in detail about what they would like to see changed on the carton. If this gentleman would send us a note we can certainly look at his requests. I have not had this complaint for some years now. Thank you for anything you can do to allow him to contact me."

    "Incident Description": "Ashley Hearth direct vent wall mounted propane heater is the product; however, the concern is specifically regarding the pilot/igniter assembly. In October of 22 I purchased 3 of these at the same time from Amazon. Subsequently, all 3 have failed. I am a retired Master Mechanic/Machinist for reference. The Pilot Assy fails because of a design flaw in that the brass tube fittings are pressed then swedged into a steel plate. Heat from the burner; expansion and contraction causes the brass fittings to fall out. This misaligns the pilot burner, thermocouple and igniter. One unit simply failed to light because the piezo tip fell out. Another melted the end off the thermocouple as it misaligned directly into the pilot flame and would not light. The third, and most concerning failed as the flame supply tube fell out of the front and continued to remain lit in the heater bottom where it doesn't belong. If the flame tip would happen to come off, there would potentially be an open pilot flame outside the heater creating a very unsafe scenario. The overall function and quality of the rest of the heater seems adequate, although I will also say that when my units arrived, all the tube nuts that secure and seal the gas lines to the gas valve and the pilot assy. were too loose. All three units were like this, and I have done an Amazon review advising customers to check this before putting in service, as it could lead to a gas leak. I was able to loosen the pilot gas line by hand on two units. I suspect this loosening is caused from shipping, and there is little the manufacturer can do. Over tightening the tube nuts at manufacture is not a good option, and shipping always beats everything to death. Especially all the way from China were these heaters are made. In conclusion: At the very least, these heaters need an upgraded pilot assembly. There are two larger BTU sizes of the same style heater plus natural gas versions of all three. Simply search Ashley heater on Amazon to see them all. If they use the same pilot assembly all these products are suspect and need further evaluation to protect consumers.

After the second tripping of the GFI, I used a voltmeter and determined that the outer case of the Breville was fully electrified, and, as I understand it, would have delivered a shock to myself or my wife if it weren't for the GFI.  I returned the product to Breville, who examined it and wrote back:  \"During the inspection, our technicians discovered unforeseen damage that was not initially evident. This required additional materials and labor to address properly. Even after doing so, safety concerns were still evident and resulted in unrepairable scenario of your unit.\"  In other words, it seems that this Breville product was so dangerous that even Breville's own technicians said they couldn't fix it.",

My oven had been on for about 45 minutes at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. I had taken my item out of the oven, placed it on top of the stove, and closed the oven door when the glass shattered. Our oven is about two years old so it is out of warranty. We live in an apartment complex where the range is included, and they usually keep extra appliances on hand in case something needs replacing. So our oven is two years old to us, but it is unclear how long they have had the oven itself. There were no injuries other than a few cuts from the glass, as I was standing a few feet within the oven.",

First, the steam pump will back flow water back to the water tank with the food particles intact. This will cause bacteria growth and mold in the water lines. Assuming the heating element is working correctly and at proper temperature there is a chance that bacteria will enter the babies food when processing food or by gravity tilt, bad water will flow into the babies food after steaming has occurred.\nSecond, pending certain foods being blended, the blade has a chance to chip or shread itself into shavings. This is dangerous. We didn't notice this on our unit but others have online. You will have to inspect the food each use to make sure the blade didn't chip or get shaved off into the food.",

    "Incident Description": "Submersible Bird-Bath Heater.  I purchased this type of product, Lollyes, Model BSV-HP003/P, 70-watt heater, made in China, in mid October 2023 via Amazon.  While in use in a water-filled birdbath in late January 2024 it started to trip the GFI outlet that powers exterior electrical devices.  As I searched for a replacement on Amazon's site I noticed many similar products have received poor reviews ( 1 star) because they also had a similar short-circuit problems.  The heater I described above has a 3-wire plug, but several models have only a simple 2-prong  power plug.  After my experience and reading reviews I believe strongly that these types of products require a thorough review for potential short circuits and faulty wiring.  Without a GFI, this type of product is a serious shock hazard.  An ohmmeter connected between the power pin the the third-wire (green) pin measured a resistance of 20,000 ohms.  That value means a \"leakage\" of about 5.5 milliamperes,  which could cause death.",

    "Incident Description": "EMCO/Andersen Fullview interchangeable screen storm door. The product in question has a removable full-size double pane insulated glass insert. This glass insert is very heavy - estimated at more than 30 lbs. It is inserted into the storm door frame from the inside of the door after removing the screen insert. In order swap the screen for the glass insert, a switch needs to be activated on the door so that the door handle lever can be moved into the full vertical position. This lever position disengages the mechanism that holds the insert (glass insert, or screen insert) in place. After inserting the heavy glass insert and returning the door handle to the horizontal position, the switch is supposed to re-engage to prevent the lever from moving into the release position, and the mechanism is supposed to retain the heavy glass insert. However, due to an unknown mechanical defect/failure, the door handle lever can be moved to the full upright and vertical position WITHOUT actuating the switch. This disengages the mechanism that retains the insert in the frame of the storm door, allowing the glass insert to free-fall into the house, potentially falling on people or pets inside the entryway. EMCO/Andersen has not acknowledged the significance this failure and will not provide replacement parts to address the defect that is causing the safety issue.",

Thought they were in wrong places etc etc. now I have ice cream frozen in the bottom of the freezer and no ice and hot at the top of it. The water wont dispense now either. The fan is making noise and the top of the fridge is warm then cool. This is crazy. Milk eggs all the stuff were supposed to keep cold or thawing of the freezer and refreezing meat etc isnt safe.
